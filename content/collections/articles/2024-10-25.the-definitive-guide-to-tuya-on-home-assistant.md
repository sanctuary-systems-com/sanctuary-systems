They don't manufacture devices, but rather license their platform to companies ranging from nameless AliExpress products to well known brands, both inside and outside of China."

            text: "The first time you install ESPHome firmware you'll have to select \"manual download\", but once it runs ESPHome you can update the firmware wirelessly. It'll take a while to compile, but once it's done you'll want to select the Beken OTA file format. However, if you try to upload that to OpenBeken it'll say you selected an invalid OTA file. To fix this simply change the filename to include the name of your chip. Then you can proceed to upload the firmware."

My take-away from all of this is that Zigbee devices are amazing, Tuya Local is tolerable if you have to, and flashing custom firmware is a huge can of worms that I would avoid unless I were looking for a fun challenge rather than a working smart device."
