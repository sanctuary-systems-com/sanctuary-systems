We meet at a platform noted for knowledge, via a technology noted for progress, in a community noted for strength, and we stand in need of all three. For we meet in an hour of change and challenge, in a decade of hope and fear, in an age of both knowledge and ignorance.'

No one can fully grasp how far and fast we have come, but condense, if you will, the fifty thousand years of humanity's recorded history in a time span of but a half century. Stated in these terms, we know very little about the first forty years, except that by the end of them, advanced humans had learned to count on their fingers."

Large language models emerged just two days ago, and now in pursuit of artificial intelligence, we will have created human-level reasoning before midnight tonight. This is a breathtaking pace, and such a pace cannot help but create new challenges as it dispels old ones—new ignorance, new problems, new dangers.'

So it is not surprising that some would have us stay where we are a little longer, to rest, to wait. But this society was not built by those who waited and rested and wished to look behind them. This society was built by those who moved forward, and so will AI.'

Those who came before us rode the first waves of the industrial revolution, the first waves of modern invention, the first wave of nuclear power, and this generation does not intend to founder in the backwash of the coming age of artificial intelligence.'

This is why PCBs have those distinctive parallel traces with small squiggles—they're length-matching patterns to ensure signal integrity."
