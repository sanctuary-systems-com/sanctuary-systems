            text: "Before diving into performance, here's my first piece of advice: if you decide to get this robot vacuum, make sure to connect it to a guest Wi-Fi network. Most commodity routers have this feature, and it's crucial for keeping the device isolated from your main computers. Like many cloud-based smart home devices, it's better to be safe than sorry when it comes to network security."

            text: "Let me start with what the Deebot N8 Pro does reasonably well. The vacuuming performance is okay – nothing spectacular, but it gets the job done. However, the mopping function leaves much to be desired. It's not great, but honestly, this is pretty much what you'd expect from similar robot vacuums in this price range. Nothing particularly special, but nothing terrible either."

            text: "The robot struggles significantly with locating itself and maintaining accurate floor maps. Whenever I move it from one floor to another, it fails to recognize the existing floor plan. Instead of using the saved map, it creates an entirely new floor map and starts the mapping process from scratch. This is incredibly annoying and defeats the purpose of having a smart robot that's supposed to learn your home's layout."

It will drive around normally, then suddenly a rotated copy of the map appears overlaid on top of the existing map. When this happens, the robot becomes completely confused and gets lost in its own virtual representation of your home.'

More frustratingly, we have an IKEA chair that sits at just the wrong height – the robot can almost, but not quite, pass underneath it. Instead of recognizing this obstacle and avoiding it, the robot repeatedly attempts to drive under the chair, only to get stuck on the chair's base."
