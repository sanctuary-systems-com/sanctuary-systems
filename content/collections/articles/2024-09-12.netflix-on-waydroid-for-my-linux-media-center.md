    description: "In the\_previous video\_I set up a Kubuntu media center with Kodi, Steam, and Retroarch, and tied it all together with Plasma Bigscreen. While doing that I found out I wasn't very happy with my options for the big streaming platforms. They kinda have third party Kodi add-ons, but the experience ranges from passable for Twitch to completely broken for Netflix."

Then we need to install Waydroid, and register it for Google Play certification. Then we need to hunt down TV APKs from APKMirror for a TV launcher and TV apps like YouTube. And finally we need to set up Widevine DRM and install Netflix.'

But the fact of the matter is that Waydroid only works on Wayland so we need to switch. To do this we'll need to open Konsole and run\_sudo apt install plasma-workspace-wayland\_and enter our password. Then we can log out and select the \"Plasma (Wayland)\" or \"Plasma Bigscreen\" options instead of the X11 options. As before we can change the default session in System Settings."
