            text: 'The C200 is a pretty run of the mill pan/tilt indoor security camera with detection features for motion, people, and crying babies. In the box you get the camera, a power adapter, some paperwork, and some mounting hardware. It comes with an app and cloud subscription, but also supports local recording and ONVIF, more on that later.'

It appears to do a little dance to callibrate the pan/tilt mechanism before settling into the red/green blinking pattern meaning it's ready for setup."

            text: "Now, I have to admit that this camera was a disappointment in terms of privacy and Home Assistant compatibility, and I would not recommend this device. It turns out there is no web interface at all and the only way to set up the camera is with the app which requires a TP-Link account and an internet connection. So let's grit our teeth and get this thing working."

However, I got another error and afterwards the camera once again vanished from the app completely.'

So for the best results we will need to go into HACS and install the third party Tapo Camera Control integration. (let me know if you're interested in a video about setting up HACS)"

Here you'll have to find the IP of your camera, either in the Tapo app or in your router's web interface. Next you'll have to enter the camera account credentials we created in the app. And finally, for some reason, the password to your TP-Link account. On the next screen there are a few camera settings which I've left at the defaults. And finally, you can add the camera to a zone if you want."
