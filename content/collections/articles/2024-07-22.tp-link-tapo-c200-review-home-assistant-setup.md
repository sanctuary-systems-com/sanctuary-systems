    title: 'TP-Link Tapo C200 review & Home Assistant setup'
    description: 'The C200 is a pretty run of the mill pan/tilt indoor security camera with detection features for motion, people, and crying babies. In the box you get the camera, a power adapter, some paperwork, and some mounting hardware. It comes with an app and cloud subscription, but also supports local recording and ONVIF, more on that later.'

It appears to do a little dance to callibrate the pan/tilt mechanism before settling into the red/green blinking pattern meaning it's ready for setup."

It turns out there is no web interface at all and the only way to set up the camera is with the app which requires a TP-Link account and an internet connection. So let's grit our teeth and get this thing working."

On the next screen there are a few camera settings which I've left at the defaults. And finally, you can add the camera to a zone if you want."
