If you'd like to do other things as well, it is technically possible to sideload APKs on Fire TV, so you can install Android versions of Kodi, Retroarch, and Steam Link, but keep in mind the storage and CPU on the Fire TV Stick are weak and tiny, so don't expect to store movies or emulate fifth generation consoles. And of course Steam Link can only stream games from your gaming PC."

It also comes with its own Retroarch frontend which works great for older consoles but doesn''t support any of the fifth generation consoles like PlayStation or Nintendo 64. However, "just enough OS" is not enough OS for Steam or Firefox or pretty much anything else. But an even bigger disappointment is the add-ons for the major streaming platforms. Most of therm are written by third parties and offer a terrible user experience.'

            text: "Let me be the first to say that if all you do is watch Netflix, just get the Fire TV, since their DRM makes it hard to use on more DIY platforms. If you'd like to do other things as well, it is technically possible to sideload APKs on Fire TV, so you can install Android versions of Kodi, Retroarch, and Steam Link, but keep in mind the storage and CPU on the Fire TV Stick are weak and tiny, so don't expect to store movies or emulate fifth generation consoles. And of course Steam Link can only stream games from your gaming PC."

It also comes with its own Retroarch frontend which works great for older consoles but doesn''t support any of the fifth generation consoles like PlayStation or Nintendo 64. However, "just enough OS" is not enough OS for Steam or Firefox or pretty much anything else. But an even bigger disappointment is the add-ons for the major streaming platforms. Most of therm are written by third parties and offer a terrible user experience.'

  Now that my home office is no longer in the living room, I'm looking for a new way to consume media from the couch. So I've been exploring various options such as a Raspberry Pi, Amazon Fire TV Stick, or a second hand thin client.

  In this table I have rated the capabilities of each approach.
